# MY-LIBERATION-NOTES
Online Diary Version

Inspired by a Korean Drama title MY LIBERATION

My journey so far is full of highs and lows that i really wish i documented somewhere maybe Diary. Smiles, I'm a Programmer! So i made myself one.

Deliberately left out the Delete and Update features because i can't go back in time to unexperience what i've already experienced, or prevent what have happened.
